# Property-Taxation
# GIS-Based Property Tax Assessment Project

### 1. Data Collection and Surveying
The project began with an extensive data collection phase, involving both field surveys and the gathering of existing records. This step was critical to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data. Survey teams were dispatched to gather property details, such as the size and structure of each house, as well as demographic information about the families living there. Additionally, existing government records and satellite imagery were utilized to cross-verify and supplement the collected data. This comprehensive approach ensured a robust dataset, laying the foundation for precise mapping and analysis.

### 2. Digitizing House Polygons in QGIS
To transform the collected data into a usable format, a detailed map of the area was created using QGIS, a powerful open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) tool. This process involved digitizing each house as a polygon on the map. High-resolution satellite images and field survey sketches were imported into QGIS, serving as basemaps for the digitization process. Each house was carefully outlined to create accurate polygonal representations. This step, termed "Digital Blueprint Creation," was crucial for visualizing and analyzing spatial data effectively.

### 3. Integrating Property and Demographic Attributes
With the house polygons in place, the next phase involved enriching these polygons with specific attributes. Each polygon was linked to a database containing detailed property and demographic information. Attributes included the size of the property, number of rooms, construction material, and the age of the building. Additionally, demographic data such as the number of occupants, their ages, occupations, and income levels were added. This comprehensive attribute integration, termed "Attribute Enrichment," enabled a multifaceted analysis of each property, providing a holistic view for government assessment.

### 4. Analysis and Application for Tax Assessment
The final phase involved the analysis and application of the GIS-based map for tax assessment. Using the enriched dataset, various spatial analyses were conducted to evaluate property values and demographic trends. Tools within QGIS facilitated the calculation of property areas, assessment of building conditions, and identification of high-value zones. This data-driven approach allowed the government to develop a fair and equitable taxation model, considering both the property characteristics and the socioeconomic status of the residents. The resulting tax assessment model not only ensured a more accurate taxation system but also provided insights for future urban planning and resource allocation.
